  <p class="excerpt">Together with a product designer we were challenged to build a more sustainable intoxication test. Current intoxication test based on breathing produce tons of plastic garbage every year. With the goal of the partner company to shift to ecological design, we set out to tackle the problem from the ground up. The solution we identified is a system based on a thermal camera and a normal camera. The system uses common face detection algorithms widely available such as Facemesh and uses the face keypoints to extract heat data points around the capilar regions in the face to detect intoxication. The prototype was build with Mediapipe to allow simple prototyping on different devices.</p>

  <p class="excerpt">Stocks are highly relevant as they drive a large part of modern wealth, there are large amounts of timeseries points freely available and they react to a plethora of signals. All of this makes them a perfect playground for data science where everyone has the possibility to test their hypothesis and algorithms against the real world. With the most recent stock crash at the verge of the COVID-19, stock markets have jumped back into many people`s attention.Stock Prediction has been long on my list of things to improve my timeseries skills, thus this is my take on <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/aifortrading-2edd6fac689d">Bruno`s state-of-the-art approach</a>. This is a reimplemantion fo the  architecture from scratch in tensorflow on Colab with TPUs and changing a few things on the architecture to my taste, with the ultimate goal of prediciting the Microsoft (MSFT) stock as accuratly as possible and a deepened knowledge of stocks and timeseries.</p>

  <p class="excerpt">Evaluation of the performance and requirements of modern deep learning object detection architectures for detection of grocery products from visual appearance.  Grocery products differ from typical object detection challenges that shape is a less reliable indicator and they typically appear in many object scenarios (50+ products). Findings show that object detection is well possible even with limited data and clever data collection strategies. Problem cases are brands with very little difference between products. We collect and open source a new dataset to push research on the topic. Research won <b>Best Paper Award at IOT2019</b></p>

  <p class="excerpt">Recently there has been a lot of interest in the research community in just-in-time interventions for healthier eating. And while some of this has been studied with phones and tablets in mind, very little reserach has been done on the the next generation of displays in the form of spatial computing headsets. To evaluate this I built a augmented reality app that would intefere shopping at a vending machine with health advice based on the nutriscore. We then designed a randomized control trial (N=61) to evaluate the experiment. Finally we used the classic experiment data in combination with new spatial data to evaluate the findinds. Our experiment shows significant improvements in the test group expecially with users that have existing food-literacy.</p>

  <h3 class="title">Business Model Testing</h3>
  <p class="excerpt">The goal for cofoundme just like any startup was to find a viable business model. We knew we were solving a problem for our users, that is helping founders find co-founders or early employees, especially those with other skills and backgrounds. However it was unclear how to monetize on this. Our customer base is mostly very early-stage startups often without funding. But fortunatly enough we are embedded in the startup investment scene and the corporate venture scene both of which have money. Thus we implemented and tried two business models. The first one targeted corporate customers who are trying to find entrepreneurial employees, we implemented a platform with a wizard of OZ approach that would automate the head-hunting process based on data, by recommending potential employees according to a search profile. The second experiment was to provide premium analytics features to investors which would allow them to take a deeper look into the trends in the startup ecosystem. Both business models showed to be viable but required significant funding to scale the user base. Unfortunatly the founders split upon the idea how such a future could be realized.</p>

  <h3 class="title">Recommendation System for relevant Jobs</h3>
  <p class="excerpt">The goal was to improve user experience by upgrading relevance of the jobs proposed to a user, relevance being a measure of how many jobs a user clicks on, how much time a user spends on a job and if he applies. The system previously only recommeded jobs based on the general attention that a job recieved on the platform. The second artifact added to recommend jobs was based on the interests and skills that a user has, essentially a content based recommendation approach. Skills and interest (both tags) were transfered to word embeddings and the set was matched to the skills of the job, with a penalty for overly many tags. The third artifact used to predict the relevance of the job was user behavior with a collaborative filtering approach. Using matrix factorization to reproduce the user job relation using the time spent by a certain user on a job as the relavance of the job.</p>

We implemented a prototype of a Facebook app with a user facing swipe interface and automated analytics for clients for a set of car features based on input from a sales person from a large German car manufacturer. Ran the prototype for a week based on a fixed marketing budget and reported the results back succesful feedback. Later pitched the product idea to a set of investors.</p>

  <h3 class="title">Risk Trend Analytics Tool</h3>
  <p class="excerpt">The goal of the project was to build a dashboard that would allow evaluation of trends for important risk topics. Trends would be evaluated based on recent development of the topic in the news. Performed initial analysis for a selected set of topics and build taxonomies to check on initial feasibility. Along side performed a design thinking study with a set of potential users to understand potential user-stories. Later on acted as the product owner to a team of developers and data-scientists to managed the development of the first MVP.</p>

  <h3 class="title">3D Object Detection NeuralNet</h3>
  <p class="excerpt">Built a 3D object detection deep neural network for a Project Tango camera to detect 3D objects in near realtime. The deep neural network was based on a state of the art architecture detecting 3D objects from voxel data. Trained to detect around 600 different objects from available research datasets and validated with a newly created set of 3D assets from the Tango camera.</p>

  <h3 class="title">Development of a Disruptive Carbon Fiber Smart Orthosis</h3>
  <p class="excerpt">While there are large investments and innovation in med tech for prostethics the market for othosis is very underdeveloped with little innovation and expensive low tech devices. Our analysis of the market however showed that there equally many or even more patiens who require an orthosis, who are not served by med tech companies since an orthosis only costs in the range of 5-10k EUR vs 50-100k EUR for a prothesis. On top through our technology evaluation our hypothesis was that with recent development in CFC materials, discoveries in bionics and IoT devices a complete disruption of the market would be possible. Therefore we engaged in the full cycle of developing a carbon fiber based smart orthosis that would disrupt the market in both price and funcionality. We went through all the stages of consumer, market and product analysis to define the specifications, based on top of which we developed a prototype. The concept together with the prototype was then successfully piched to a medical device company and a CFC engineering firm who decided to design a production ready device.</p>

  <h3 class="title">Landmark Detection in Changing Light</h3>
  <p class="excerpt">Exploring the impact of changing light conditions on landmark detection. Benchmarking different keypoint & descriptor algorithms against different light conditions and evaluating the impact of those changes on the extracted keypoints, descriptors and landmarks. Collected a dataset of differing light conditions from a broad set of stable webcams. Light conditions included scenarios as change of day-time, season, shadows, weather changes, and artificial lightning. Evaluation showed that algorithms are extremely susceptiple to even small changes in light and recognition fell below 5%. The solution is to have different keypoints & descriptors depending on time to recognize landmarks, this however leads to an explosion of the lookup database. Developed a solution to build efficient landmark lookups with datetime segmented descriptor databases.</p>
