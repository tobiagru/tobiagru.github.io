lead_text: 'While there are large investments and innovation in med tech for prostethics the market for othosis is very underdeveloped with little innovation and expensive low tech devices. Our analysis of the market however showed that there equally many or even more patiens who require an orthosis, who are not served by med tech companies since an orthosis only costs in the range of 5-10k EUR vs 50-100k EUR for a prothesis. On top through our technology evaluation our hypothesis was that with recent development in CFC materials, discoveries in bionics and IoT devices a complete disruption of the market would be possible. Therefore we engaged in the full cycle of developing a carbon fiber based smart orthosis that would disrupt the market in both price and funcionality. We went through all the stages of consumer, market and product analysis to define the specifications, based on top of which we developed a prototype. The concept together with the prototype was then successfully piched to a medical device company and a CFC engineering firm who decided to design a production ready device.'
