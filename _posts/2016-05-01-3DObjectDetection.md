lead_text: 'Built a 3D object detection deep neural network for a Project Tango camera to detect 3D objects in near realtime. The deep neural network was based on a state of the art architecture detecting 3D objects from voxel data. Trained to detect around 600 different objects from available research datasets and validated with a newly created set of 3D assets from the Tango camera.'
