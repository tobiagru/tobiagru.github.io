lead_text: 'Our Hypothesis was that a gamified approach to rating features of products, similar to how the swipe on tinder works could be a viable market research platform. We implemented a prototype of a Facebook app with a user facing swipe interface and automated analytics for clients for a set of car features based on input from a sales person from a large German car manufacturer. Ran the prototype for a week based on a fixed marketing budget and reported the results back succesful feedback. Later pitched the product idea to a set of investors.'
