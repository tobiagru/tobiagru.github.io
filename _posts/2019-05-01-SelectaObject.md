lead_text: 'Evaluation of the performance and requirements of modern deep learning object detection architectures for detection of grocery products from visual appearance.  Grocery products differ from typical object detection challenges that shape is a less reliable indicator and they typically appear in many object scenarios (50+ products). Findings show that object detection is well possible even with limited data and clever data collection strategies. Problem cases are brands with very little difference between products. We collect and open source a new dataset to push research on the topic. Research won <b>Best Paper Award at IOT2019</b>'
