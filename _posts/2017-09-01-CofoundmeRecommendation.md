lead_text: 'The goal was to improve user experience by upgrading relevance of the jobs proposed to a user, relevance being a measure of how many jobs a user clicks on, how much time a user spends on a job and if he applies. The system previously only recommeded jobs based on the general attention that a job recieved on the platform. The second artifact added to recommend jobs was based on the interests and skills that a user has, essentially a content based recommendation approach. Skills and interest (both tags) were transfered to word embeddings and the set was matched to the skills of the job, with a penalty for overly many tags. The third artifact used to predict the relevance of the job was user behavior with a collaborative filtering approach. Using matrix factorization to reproduce the user job relation using the time spent by a certain user on a job as the relavance of the job.'
