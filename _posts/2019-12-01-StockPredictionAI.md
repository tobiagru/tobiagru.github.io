lead_text: 'Stocks are highly relevant as they drive a large part of modern wealth, there are large amounts of timeseries points freely available and they react to a plethora of signals. All of this makes them a perfect playground for data science where everyone has the possibility to test their hypothesis and algorithms against the real world. With the most recent stock crash at the verge of the COVID-19, stock markets have jumped back into many people`s attention.Stock Prediction has been long on my list of things to improve my timeseries skills, thus this is my take on <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/aifortrading-2edd6fac689d">Bruno`s state-of-the-art approach</a>. This is a reimplemantion fo the  architecture from scratch in tensorflow on Colab with TPUs and changing a few things on the architecture to my taste, with the ultimate goal of prediciting the Microsoft (MSFT) stock as accuratly as possible and a deepened knowledge of stocks and timeseries.'
