lead_text: 'Recently there has been a lot of interest in the research community in just-in-time interventions for healthier eating. And while some of this has been studied with phones and tablets in mind, very little reserach has been done on the the next generation of displays in the form of spatial computing headsets. To evaluate this I built a augmented reality app that would intefere shopping at a vending machine with health advice based on the nutriscore. We then designed a randomized control trial (N=61) to evaluate the experiment. Finally we used the classic experiment data in combination with new spatial data to evaluate the findinds. Our experiment shows significant improvements in the test group expecially with users that have existing food-literacy.'
