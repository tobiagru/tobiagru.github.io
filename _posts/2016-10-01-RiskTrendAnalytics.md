lead_text: 'The goal of the project was to build a dashboard that would allow evaluation of trends for important risk topics. Trends would be evaluated based on recent development of the topic in the news. Performed initial analysis for a selected set of topics and build taxonomies to check on initial feasibility. Along side performed a design thinking study with a set of potential users to understand potential user-stories. Later on acted as the product owner to a team of developers and data-scientists to managed the development of the first MVP.'
