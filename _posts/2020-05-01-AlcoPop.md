lead_text: 'Together with a product designer we were challenged to build a more sustainable intoxication test. Current intoxication test based on breathing produce tons of plastic garbage every year. With the goal of the partner company to shift to ecological design, we set out to tackle the problem from the ground up. The solution we identified is a system based on a thermal camera and a normal camera. The system uses common face detection algorithms widely available such as Facemesh and uses the face keypoints to extract heat data points around the capilar regions in the face to detect intoxication. The prototype was build with Mediapipe to allow simple prototyping on different devices.'
