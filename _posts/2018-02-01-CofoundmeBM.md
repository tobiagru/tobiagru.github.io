lead_text: 'The goal for cofoundme just like any startup was to find a viable business model. We knew we were solving a problem for our users, that is helping founders find co-founders or early employees, especially those with other skills and backgrounds. However it was unclear how to monetize on this. Our customer base is mostly very early-stage startups often without funding. But fortunatly enough we are embedded in the startup investment scene and the corporate venture scene both of which have money. Thus we implemented and tried two business models. The first one targeted corporate customers who are trying to find entrepreneurial employees, we implemented a platform with a wizard of OZ approach that would automate the head-hunting process based on data, by recommending potential employees according to a search profile. The second experiment was to provide premium analytics features to investors which would allow them to take a deeper look into the trends in the startup ecosystem. Both business models showed to be viable but required significant funding to scale the user base. Unfortunatly the founders split upon the idea how such a future could be realized.'
