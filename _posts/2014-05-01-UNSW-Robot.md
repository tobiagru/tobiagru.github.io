lead_text: 'We built a controller & interface for the 6-axis ABB robot to allow picking and sorting chocolates. This includes motor controls, computer vision system to detect and classify chocolates, path planning for optimal picking routes and a GUI to control everything. We used Matlab for GUI, simulation and general control, C++ to improve performance in control and detection, and Rapid as the interface to steer the physical motor controller.'
